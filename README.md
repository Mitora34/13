# The Survivor of the Great Dualboot

Everything started from the Great Dualboot Era
Once, when I was writing the code(header) on C++ and testing
I wanted to move it into /usr/include so I could use <library_name.hpp> rather than "library_name.hpp" path in GNU/Linux Ubuntu
And then...OI
BOOM! I am searching that file but I could not find it anywhere. I thought it is gone forever and googled how to find that file but I still could not do anything
So I rewrite that file once again because there is no way I could find it. Maybe 1-2 month later I wrote the as nothing happened but when I write "#include" VS code suggested strange "13" file.
I was intersted and included it to my project but when I checked the definition by pressing "f12" key I shocked. When I read that definition I remembered something. It was the file i was searching for a while, but I dont needed it anymore because I have written the exact copy of this file. So when the GNU/Linux Ubuntu was deleted from my old laptop I have everything backed up from my own github repo
So that happened because of GNU/Linux Ubuntu bug when i moved my header from my home directory to /usr/include path it suddenly "dissappered". Turns out, it was just renamed to "13" all along.
That was the actual story of this header.
